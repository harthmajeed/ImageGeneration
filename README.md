# Image Generation
This was the term project done in the "Deep Learning" course, this course was taken in Fall term of 2020 with the University of Toronto, this course is offered under their School of Continuing Studies, this course is part of the Artificial Intelligence certification program.

The topic I picked for this project was image generation, this is known as GAN, Generative Adversarial Network. You feed the network a dataset of images, the network will try to improve itself during training to produce an image that is closer and closer to the training dataset.

There are 4 categories of image dataset that were trained, all using the same network arhcitecture.

Here are samples below:

The documenation (pdf) uploaded is a short presenation slide, this will contain an overview of the project.

More work is to be done soon regarding the LEGO problems encountered, this will be in another project.
